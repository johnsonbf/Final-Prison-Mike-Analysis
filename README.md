## Notes
- Data cleaning & parsing
  - ETL (could be multiple tables)
  - postgres/SQL
- Visualization - Tableau
- Machine learning
- Presentation

## Things mentioned in class
- A database can be any place you save and store your data - local machine or in something like PostGres
- For each team member to get in a specific amount of commits, whatever section they are responsible for can be broken into small tasks that are then pushed as new commits
- Each section of the project does not need to be completed or brainstormed linearly
  - for example: ML model can be brainstormed and mocked up at the same time the database is created
