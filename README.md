## Things mentioned in class

- A database can be any place you save and store your data - local machine or in something like PostGres
- For each team member to get in a specific amount of commits, whatever section they are responsible for can be broken into small tasks that are then pushed as new commits
- Each section of the project does not need to be completed or brainstormed linearly
  - for example: ML model can be brainstormed and mocked up at the same time the database is created
  
  
 ## Questions to consider for ML model
 
 - What attributes contribute to a review over x?
  - x can be explored in python with statistics description
